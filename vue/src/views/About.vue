      <h1>Abacus</h1>
      <h2>eLearning made easy.</h2>
      <h3>Abacus is an eLearning portal designed by a group of Tech Elevator students from the NLR(3) cohort. 
        Simililiar to that of the ancient mathematical tool, Abacus keeps track of course progression for teachers and students.
        Just like sliding beads across a wire frame, students see in real time when assignments are completed. 
        At Abacus anyone can create a course to teach or jump in learning a new skill. Sign-up for an account and start gaining knowledge today!
