Abacus Learning was the final capstone project for the National Live Remote #3 cohort of Tech Elevator.

Under the guidance of a SCRUM master and utilzing Agile development sprint cycles, with this project my team and I built a functional learning management system.  It is built with the VueJS framework and Java Spring Boot on the backend.

A user's experience is that they can log in and immediately can create courses, add assignments, check grades as a teacher, and simultaneously can join classes as a student.

Further development in progress to continuously improve the user experience.
